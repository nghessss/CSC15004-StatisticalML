\section{Applications}

We investigated the applications of our model across various domains. The model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text makes it suitable for question-answering tasks with a chatbot.



\subsection{Chatbot Application}

We used Gemini 2.5 Flash~\cite{comanici2025gemini} to create a chatbot that can answer questions based on the provided context. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner, leveraging the model's capabilities to generate human-like responses.

When a user enters a question accompanied by a short video, the video goes through our two-step captioning process--video captioning and keyframe captioning--and the chatbot then answers the question based on the generated captions. The chatbot is capable of understanding the context of the video and providing relevant answers to user queries.

\subsection{User Interface}

% We designed a user-friendly interface for the chatbot, allowing users to interact with it easily. The interface includes a video player for watching the video, a text input box for entering questions, and a chat window for displaying the chatbot's responses. This setup ensures a seamless user experience, enabling users to engage with the chatbot while watching the video.
